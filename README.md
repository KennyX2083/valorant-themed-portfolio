A personal web portfolio inspired by Valorant’s sleek UI and Iso's color scheme.
Built from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my background in Computer Science, projects, and technical skills.
Designed with a focus on interactivity, animation, and clean UX — combining my interests in design, gaming, and software development.
